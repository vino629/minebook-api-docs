minebook-api-docs
=================

This repo is intended for documentations for the Minebook API and submitting
issues related to it. We are currently migrating docs from google docs to this
repo. If you have trouble using the wiki, you can fallback to our good old google docs:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Srr_8tjAnB_dm8DFcZyE00zSOFkXbioWVzVWi1uSnn4/edit?pli=1


Current Status
--------------
At least 90% of GET API have been implemented, though they may not
be stable at this point; we may add or remove spec when needed.

OAuth support is not in place yet, but for testing purposes you can
authenticate with your username and password. See `/auth` for details

We are looking for contributors for improving the API specs
and writing tutorials for using the API for web
applications.

If you have issues using the API, please submit issues at
https://github.com/xkxx/minebook-api-docs/issues . 


TODO
----

1. OAuth support
2. POST/PUT/DELETE
3. Rate limit
